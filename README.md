This is the github repository of our Online Convex Network Dictionary Leanring algorithm ([online cvxNDL](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/08/01/2022.07.28.501904.full.pdf)). 

## Packages
The following packages are needed to run the code
```
python=3.8
pandas
matplotlib
ipdb
tqdm
scikit-learn
k-means-constrained
cvxpy
networkx
tensorly
psutil
```

## To run the optimization algorithm 
We provide synthetic data generated by the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) for quick verfication. For the full ChIA-Drop dataset, please refer to this [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109355).

To run the example for the synthetic dataset
```
source run_example.sh
```

Note that we separate the MCMC sampling procedure from the iterative optimization procedure to improve the overall efficiency. The MCMC sampling procedure can be found in the folder `sampling`.

## To view the results in Jupyter notebook
Please go to the folder `jupyter_notebook` and select the corresponding notebooks for detailed results.

## Contact
Please contact Jianhao Peng (jianhao2@illinois.edu) or Chao Pan (chaopan2@illinois.edu) if you have any questions.
